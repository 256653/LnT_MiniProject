# ABOUT
A gaming application which provides user an option to select between two games, that is Tic-Tac-Toe and Guess the number.

**Tic-Tac-Toe**
Tic-Tac-Toe  is a minimalist take on the classic paper-and-pencil game for two players. Users can take turns marking the Xs and Os in the 3x3 grid. The first mark must be X and the second is O. Players win by placing three of their marks in either a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row. If neither player can place three in a row, the program declares a cat game.

**Guess the Number**
Guess the number is a game in which the user has to guess a number assigned by the system by using the directions given by the system.
